-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resolve and install/deploy hierarchical dependencies, from an exploded directory
tree, using the path and passed regexp masks to decide on group, artifact,
version and dependencies.

This is useful to install/deploy the JARs from a multi-jar project, that has not
been mavenised into its own module namespace.
